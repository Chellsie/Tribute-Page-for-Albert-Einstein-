                <h2>Early Life</h2>
                <p>
                    <b>Albert Einstein</b>, born on <b>March 14, 1879</b>, in <b>Ulm, Germany</b>, was <b>a theoretical physicist</b> who 
                    developed the <b>theory of relativity</b>, one of the two pillars of modern physics.                    
                </p><br>
                <p>
                    Einstein was born to a secular Jewish family. His father, <b>Hermann Einstein</b>, was an engineer, 
                    and his mother, <b>Pauline Koch</b>, was a pianist. He had one younger sister, <b>Maja</b>. As a child, 
                    Einstein was quiet and slow to speak but showed an early fascination with the world, particularly after 
                    receiving a compass from his father at age five. He also developed a love for mathematics, mastering calculus 
                    by age fourteen after discovering a geometry book.
                </p><br>
                <p>
                    He attended <b>Catholic elementary school</b> and later the <b>Luitpold Gymnasium in Munich</b>, where he 
                    disliked the rigid teaching methods. Excelling in math and science, he struggled with other subjects and 
                    developed a distrust of authority. <b>At 15, he dropped out of school</b> and joined his family in Italy, 
                    who had moved there due to his father's business difficulties.
                </p><br>
                <p>
                    At 16, Einstein attempted the entrance exam for the <b>Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETH) in Zurich </b> 
                    but failed some sections despite excelling in math and physics. After a year at a more independent-thinking 
                    Swiss secondary school, he successfully gained admission to <b>ETH in 1896 to study physics and mathematics. </b>
                    Despite disliking formal lectures, he graduated in 1900. After struggling to find a teaching job, he became 
                    a patent examiner in Bern in 1902, a position that allowed him to develop his <b>revolutionary theories.</b>

                <p>
                <b><i>Theory of Relativity:</i></b>
                Einstein developed both the special and general theories of relativity. These theories revolutionized our
                understanding of space, time, gravity, and the universe. <br>
                <b><i>Photoelectric Effect:</i></b>
                His explanation of the photoelectric effect, which describes how light can cause electrons to be emitted 
                from a material, earned him the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921. <br>
                <b><i>Mass-Energy Equivalence (E=mcÂ²):</i></b>
                This famous equation demonstrates the relationship between mass and energy, showing that mass can be 
                onverted into a large amount of energy and vice versa. <br>
                <b><i>Brownian Motion:</i></b>
                Einstein's work on Brownian motion, the erratic movement of particles suspended in a fluid, provided 
                strong evidence for the existence of atoms and molecules. <br>
                <b><i>Quantum Theory of Light:</i></b>
                Einstein contributed to the development of quantum theory by proposing that light can behave as both 
                a wave and a particle (wave-particle duality), and that light consists of packets of energy called photons. <br>
                <b><i>Bose-Einstein Condensate:</i></b>
                Einstein's work on the behavior of particles at extremely low temperatures laid the foundation for the 
                concept of the Bose-Einstein condensate. <br>
                <b><i>Refrigerator Design:</i></b>
                Along with Leo Szilard, Einstein also invented a refrigerator that did not require electricity.

                    impact on the scientific community. <br>
                    <b><i>Numerous Honorary Doctorates:</i></b> Einstein received ten honorary doctorates from various 
                    institutions between 1909 and 1935. <br>
